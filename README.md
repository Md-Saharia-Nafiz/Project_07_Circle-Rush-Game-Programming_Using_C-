# Circle Rush Game Programming in C++

Circle Rush is a fun console-based C++ game where the player dodges falling balls to score points.
It helps beginners practice basic C++ concepts like loops, functions, and arrays while enjoying simple gameplay.


## 📄Description:

Circle Rush is a simple and engaging console-based game developed in C++.
The player must dodge falling balls and survive as long as possible to score points.
It is built using C++ concepts like loops, functions, and arrays.
The game features smooth gameplay, a scoring system, and game over conditions.
Perfect for beginners to practice programming logic and understand basic game mechanics.
A fun way to learn and apply C++ skills in a small project.


## 💡 Key Concepts Used:

(i) Loops (for/while) for game progression
(ii) Functions for organizing code
(iii) Arrays or vectors to manage falling balls
(vi) Conditional statements for collision detection
(v) Basic input/output handling in console
(vi) Simple game logic and score tracking


## ✨ Features:

- Console-based gameplay with simple controls
- Dodge falling balls to survive and score points
- Score tracking to challenge yourself
- Game over condition when too many balls are missed
- Beginner-friendly C++ project for learning game programming


## 🔔 Purpose:

To practice basic C++ programming concepts like loops, functions, and arrays. To learn simple game logic and collision detection in a console environment. To create a fun and interactive project for beginner programmers.


## 🧠 Concepts Practiced:

=> Loops and conditional statements
=> Functions for modular code
=> Arrays or vectors for object management
=> User input handling
=> Basic game logic and score tracking


## ▶️ How to Run:
